    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Will and I'm a UX Designer.</p>
    <p>Shifting from being a programmer for a large company in the US and an English teacher in Japan, I decided to become a UX designer because I wanted to help improve people's quality of life while working in the tech industry. I am strong at UX research and testing because I am always curious what makes people tick. To tie this all together; Using the skills I picked up from being a programmer and teacher, along with my strengths in UX, I recently worked in a group project where I lead the team with quality data from interviews of users and tests of prototypes that would drive our design decisions.</p>
