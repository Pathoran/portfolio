    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Will and I'm a UX Designer focused on human centered design methods and tools.</p>
    <p>Shifting from being a programmer for a large company in the US and an English teacher in Japan, 
        I decided to become a UX designer because I wanted to help improve people's quality of life while working in the tech 
        industry. I am strong at UX research and testing because I am always curious what makes people tick. To tie this all 
        together; Using the skills I picked up from being a programmer and teacher, along with my strengths in UX, I recently 
        worked in a group project where I lead the team with quality data from interviews of users and tests of prototypes that 
        would drive our design decisions.</p>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <h5>Project Summary</h5>
    <p>
        My group and I collaborated in the research and improvement of a functionality in the application "Nextdoor"
    </p>
    <h5>What I did:</h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
            <li>User Research</li>
            <li>Sketch Mockups</li>
            <li>Wireframe</li>
            <li>Clickable Prototype</li>
            <li>Usability Test</il>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Brief</h4>
    <h5>Product background</h5>
    <p>Nextdoor is a local social networking service for neighborhoods with 66 million users across 11 countries. 
        The app provides a digital platofrm for users in each 'neighborhood' to communicate with one another.
    </p>
    <h5>Project Goals:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Improvethe functionality of the 'connect with your neighbors' function</li>
            <li>Find ways for users to match with neighbors and meet in person based on their hobbies and passions, and create 
                a network
            </li>
            <li>Explore the ability for users to create, organize, and participate in in-person events based on their passions</li>
            <li>Set levels of privacy for the user</li>
            <li>Find a way to protect under 18 year olds who also want to connect with people</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Discovery and Research</h4>
    <h5>What we did and learned:</h5>
    <p>
        <img src="Competitor Analysis.png" alt="Competitor Analysis" style="width:350px;height:250px">
        <img src="Affinity Map.png" alt="Affinity Map">
        <br>A competitive analysis was done initially to learn about what Nextdoor is currently doing and the design 
        patterns of existing competitors. This showed us that Nextdoor was not following current design patterns and that 
        the application might be improved in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next 10 user interviews were conducted. Taking the obervations from each interview, my team put together an affinity map 
        to discover strong trends in the data that we can take actionable steps towards. Through synthesizing the data, we 
        discovered strong trends that users:
        <ul>
            <li>Make friends through existing friends</li>
            <li>Make friends through hobbies and interests</li>
            <li>Join clubs/events through friend's recommendations</li>
            <li>Feel safer in big groups than by themselves</li>
            <li>Trust strangers as they learned more information about them and meeting them in person</li>
            <li>Are selective with what information they share about themselves</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5>Roadblocks and what we overcame:</h5>
    <p>We all discovered that, as this is was our first group project, we all have a different way of approaching the UX design
        process. This caused for a lot of insightful debate as to how to approach the design process and how to proceed forward. To 
        overcome this, we each discussed what we had to say and agreed as a team how to move forward. We also had our General Assembly 
        instructor help with what to focus on, and we learned more about how to work as a group from the experience. One thing that 
        we did not do during the user interviews was understand the root reason why someone would want to meet new people. To solve 
        this, we decided to hypothesize the reason using Maslow's hierarchy of needs and test it later during usability testing.
